# Feature Specification: Fix Missing generateId Export in Utils Module

**Feature Branch**: `007-fix-generateid-export`
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "BUG SPECIFICATION: Frontend Build Failure — Export generateId doesn't exist in target module

./hooks/useToast.tsx (5:1)

here is the exact run time build error:

"""

Build Error

Export generateId doesn't exist in target module
./hooks/useToast.tsx (5:1)

Export generateId doesn't exist in target module
 3 | import { useState, useCallback, createContext, useContext, ReactNode } from "react";
 4 | import type { Toast, ToastType } from "@/types"
> 5 | import { generateId } from "@/lib/utils";
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 6 |
 7 | interface ToastContextType {
 8 |   toasts: Toast[];

The export generateId was not found in module [project]/lib/utils.ts [app-client] (ecmascript).

Did you mean to import cn?

All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.

Import traces:
  Client Component Browser:
    ./hooks/useToast.tsx [Client Component Browser]
    ./components/Providers.tsx [Client Component Browser]
    ./components/Providers.tsx [Server Component]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Runs Frontend Successfully (Priority: P1)

Developer runs `npm run dev` in the frontend directory and the Next.js development server starts without build errors, becoming available at http://localhost:3000. The application renders properly without showing module resolution errors related to missing generateId export.

**Why this priority**: This is critical as the entire frontend is currently non-functional without this utility function. Without it, developers cannot work on the application and users cannot access the UI.

**Independent Test**: The frontend server can be started successfully and the UI renders without module resolution errors, proving the generateId function has been properly exported from the utility module.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh development environment with all other dependencies installed, **When** the developer runs `npm run dev`, **Then** the server starts without "Export generateId doesn't exist in target module" errors and becomes available at http://localhost:3000

2. **Given** the missing generateId export in lib/utils.ts, **When** the useToast hook tries to import `generateId from "@/lib/utils"`, **Then** the import succeeds without errors

---

### User Story 2 - Toast System Functions Properly (Priority: P2)

The toast notification system in the application works correctly, with each toast receiving a unique ID generated by the generateId utility function imported from "@/lib/utils".

**Why this priority**: Essential for the toast notification functionality to work properly. Without unique IDs, toast messages may not display correctly or may conflict with each other.

**Independent Test**: Individual toast notifications can be displayed and managed without throwing import errors related to the generateId function.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the frontend with properly configured generateId export, **When** toast notifications are triggered, **Then** each toast receives a unique ID and displays correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Module Integrity Maintained (Priority: P3)

The Next.js build system can compile the application successfully, with all utility functions properly exported from the utils module, ensuring consistent behavior between development and production environments.

**Why this priority**: Important for deployment and ensuring no other components face similar import issues.

**Independent Test**: The application can be built successfully using `npm run build` without module resolution errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configured utility module with all necessary exports, **When** the build process runs, **Then** all modules resolve correctly and the build completes successfully

---

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST export the generateId function from lib/utils.ts module
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure the generateId function generates unique IDs for toast notifications
- **FR-003**: useToast hook MUST successfully import generateId from "@/lib/utils"
- **FR-004**: Frontend application MUST compile and run without module resolution errors for generateId
- **FR-005**: The generateId function MUST return a string identifier that is unique across multiple calls
- **FR-006**: Build system MUST resolve "@/lib/utils" imports for generateId during compilation

### Key Entities

- **Utility Module**: The lib/utils.ts file providing shared utility functions including generateId
- **Toast System**: Notification system that depends on unique IDs for proper functioning
- **useToast Hook**: React hook that consumes the generateId utility for creating unique toast identifiers

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Frontend application compiles successfully 100% of the time without "Export generateId doesn't exist" errors
- **SC-002**: Toast notifications display with unique IDs without import-related errors during development
- **SC-003**: Build process completes successfully with no generateId module resolution failures
- **SC-004**: Development server starts within 30 seconds of running `npm run dev`
